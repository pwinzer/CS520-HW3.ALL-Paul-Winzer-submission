Sample files ex.txt and cw14.txt come from Figure 6.4(a) from the textbook and problem 14 of this class's classwork respectively.
The main difference is that the program treats adjacency matrix inputs as 0-based.
So nodes in ex.txt are not 1-8 but instead 0-7.
And nodes in cw14.txt are not A-H but instead 0-10.
